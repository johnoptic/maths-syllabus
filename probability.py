5. Probability

    Apply ideas of randomness, fairness and equally likely events to calculate expected outcomes. 
    Relate relative expected frequencies to the theoretical probability.
    Understand that empirical unbiased samples tend towards theoretical probability distributions, with increasing sample size.
    Enumerate sets and combinations of sets systematically, using tables, grids, Venn diagrams and tree diagrams.
    Record describe and analyse the frequency of outcomes of probability experiments using tables and frequency trees.
    Calculate the probability of independent and dependent combined events, including using tree diagrams and other representations.
