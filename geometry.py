4. Geometry and measures

Properties and constructions 

    Apply the properties of angles at a point, angles at a point on a straight line, and vertically opposite angles.
    Understand and use alternate and corresponding angles on parallel lines and derive and use the sum of angles in a triangle.
    Derive and apply the properties and definitions of special types of quadrilaterals, including square, rectangle, parallelogram, trapezium, kite and rhombus and triangles.
    Use conventional terms and notations: points, lines, vertices, edges, planes, parallel lines, perpendicular lines, right angles, polygons, regular polygons and polygons with reflection and/or rotation symmetries.
    Use the standard conventions for labelling and referring to the sides and angles of triangles and the basic congruence criteria for triangles (SSS, SAS, ASA, RHS).
    Apply angle facts, triangle congruence, similarity and properties of quadrilaterals, Pythagoras' Theorem and use known results to obtain simple proofs.
    Describe and construct congruent and similar shapes on coordinate axes, by considering rotation, reflection, translation and enlargement.
    Identify and apply circle definitions and properties, including centre, radius, chord, diameter, circumference, tangent, arc, sector and segment.
    Construct and interpret plans and elevations of 3D shapes.

Mensuration and calculation

    Measure line segments and angles in geometric figures, including interpreting maps and scale drawings and use of bearings.
    Know and apply formulae to calculate: the area of triangles, parallelograms, trapezia; the volume of cuboids and other right prisms (including cylinders). 
    Calculate perimeters of 2D shapes, including circles; areas of circles and composite shapes; surface area and volume of spheres, pyramids, cones and composite solids.
    use standard units of measure like length, area, volume/capacity, mass, time, and money.

Vectors

    Apply addition and subtraction of vectors, multiplication of vectors by a scalar, and diagrammatic and column representations of vectors.
    Use vectors to construct geometric arguments and proofs.
    Describe translations as 2D vectors.
