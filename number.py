1. Number

Structure and calculation

    Decimals, Integers(positive and negative), Fractions
    Symbols =, ≠, <, >, ≤, ≥
    Applying the four operations, including formal written methods, to integers, decimals and simple fractions (proper and improper), and mixed numbers – all both positive and negative.
    Using place value (e.g. when working with very large or very small numbers, and when calculating with decimals) 
    Recognise and use relationships between operations, including inverse operations (e.g. cancellation to simplify calculations and expressions.)
    Use conventional notation for the priority of operations, including brackets, powers, roots and reciprocals.
    Use the concepts and vocabulary of prime numbers, factors (divisors), multiples, common factors, common multiples, highest common factor, lowest common multiple, prime factorisation, including using product notation and the unique factorisation theorem
    Apply systematic listing strategies and use the product rule for counting.
    Use positive integer powers and associated real roots (square, cube and higher), recognise powers of 2, 3, 4, 5.
    Estimate the powers and roots of any given positive number.
    Calculate with roots, and with integer and fractional indices.
    Calculate exactly with fractions and multiples of π. 
    Simplify surd expressions involving squares and rationalise denominators 

Fractions, decimals and percentages

    Work interchangeably with decimals and their fractions. 
    Change recurring decimals into their corresponding fractions. 
    Interpret fractions and percentages as operators. 

Measures and accuracy

    Use standard units of mass, length, time and money.
    Check calculations using approximation and estimation.
    Round numbers and degree of accuracy.
    Use inequality notation for simple error intervals due to truncation or rounding.
    Interpret limits of accuracy, including upper and lower bounds.
