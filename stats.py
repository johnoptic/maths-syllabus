6. Statistics

    Knowing the limitations of sampling, infer properties of populations or distributions from a sample.
    Interpret and construct tables, charts and diagrams, including frequency tables, bar charts, pie charts and pictograms.
    Construct and interpret diagrams for grouped discrete data and continuous data.
    Interpret, analyse and compare the distributions of data sets from empirical distributions, graphical representation and appropriate measures of central tendency.
    Apply statistics to describe a population.
    Use and interpret scatter graphs of bivariate data; recognise the correlation and know that it does not indicate causation.
