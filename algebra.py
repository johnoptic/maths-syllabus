    Interpret simple expressions as functions with inputs and outputs.

Graphs 

    Identify parallel and perpendicular lines.
    Find the equation of the line through two given points, or through one point with a given gradient.
    Work with coordinates in all four quadrants. 
    Identify and interpret gradients and intercepts of linear functions graphically and algebraically.
    Interpret roots, intercepts, and turning points of quadratic functions graphically.
    Recognise and use the equation of a circle with the centre at the origin and find the equation of a tangent to a circle at a given point. 

Solving equations and inequalities

    Solve quadratic equations algebraically by factoring, completing the square and using the quadratic formula.
    Find approximate solutions using a graph.
    Solve linear equations in one unknown algebraically.
    Translate simple situations or procedures into algebraic expressions or formulae.

Sequences 

    Recognise and use sequences of triangular, square and cube numbers, simple arithmetic progressions, Fibonacci type sequences, quadratic sequences, and simple geometric progressions.
    Deduce expressions to calculate the nth term of linear and quadratic sequences.
    Generate terms of a sequence from either a term-to-term or a position-to-term rule
