3. Ratio, proportion and rates of change

    Use ratio notation, including reduction to simplest form.
    Apply ratio to real contexts and problems involving conversion, comparison, scaling, mixing, and concentrations.
    Change freely between related standard units (e.g. time, length, area, volume/capacity, mass) and compound units (e.g. speed, rates of pay, prices, density, pressure) in numerical and algebraic contexts.
    Understand and use proportion as equality of ratios and relate ratios to fractions and to linear functions.
    Define percentage as 'number of parts per hundred'; interpret percentages and percentage changes as a fraction or a decimal.
    Express one quantity as a percentage of another; compare two quantities using percentages and work with percentages greater than 100%.
    Solve problems involving percentage change, including percentage increase/decrease and original value problems, and simple interest including in financial mathematics.
    Solve problems involving direct and inverse proportion, including graphical and algebraic representations. 
    Use compound units such as speed, rates of pay, unit pricing, density and pressure.
    Compare lengths, areas and volumes using ratio notation; make links to similarity and scale factors.
    Understand that X is inversely proportional to Y is equivalent to X is proportional to 1 Y.
    Construct and interpret equations that describe direct and inverse proportion.
    Interpret the gradient of a straight line graph as a rate of change; recognise and interpret graphs that illustrate direct and inverse proportion.
    Apply the concepts of average and instantaneous rate of change in numerical, algebraic and graphical contexts.
    Set up, solve and interpret the answers to growth and decay problems, including compound interest and work with general iterative processes.
